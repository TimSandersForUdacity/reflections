What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create the directory and initial meta data required to start a repository. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

In that it is an area to consolidate file changes to be made as one logical commit. It also separates these files from a possibly disorganized working directory containing files that may never be committed.  

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By adding all the necessary files for the logical change to the staging area prior to making the commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would help to keep a logical group of commits/changes related to a release or functional change consolidated in order to isolate testing and development to that one feature change or release. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It helps you to separate and organize logicalchanges to the source code and to understand the visibility of those changes through the branches.
